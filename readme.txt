Show your WordPress admin notices in a growlike / better way, and snooze them whenever you see fit.

== Description ==

Show your WordPress admin notices in a growlike / better way, and snooze them whenever you see fit.

This WordPress plug-in aims to make admin notices more colorful and noticable so they are really an addition to your admin.

In addition to making them more noticable WP Growl also makes it possible to snooze notices for you so you can really keep focus on the work you should do now.

And last but not least, WP Growl is here to fight those annoying notices being abused for advertising! We try to hide any notices being used by plug-ins.
